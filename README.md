# Building Type Classification (Python SciKit)
*Does Form follow Function? Case Study Hamburg*

Architects and planners have always assumed that there is a relationship between form and function. This work is investigating if the function of a building can be predicted based on its geometrical attributes by using supervised machine learning techniques. Supervised learning consists in learning the link between two datasets: the observed data X and an external variable y that we are trying to predict, usually called “target” or “labels”
